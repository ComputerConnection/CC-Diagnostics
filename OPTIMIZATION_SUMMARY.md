## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Lazy Import Pattern:
```python
# Global cache
_psutil = None

def _get_psutil():
    global _psutil
    if _psutil is None:
        import psutil
        _psutil = psutil
    return _psutil
```

### Smart Caching:
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def _get_status_for_percentage(value, warning, critical):
    # Cached computation logic
    pass
```

### Efficient Error Handling:
```python
try:
    # Fast operation with timeout
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=10, capture_output=True)
except (subprocess.TimeoutExpired, OSError):
    # Cache negative results to avoid retries
    _cache[key] = (default_result, current_time)
```

## üéØ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Lazy Loading**: All expensive imports deferred until needed
2. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching with appropriate TTLs
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource disposal
4. **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when optional features fail
5. **Platform Awareness**: OS-specific optimizations
6. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal object creation in hot paths
7. **Thread Safety**: Proper synchronization for GUI operations

## üîÆ Future Optimization Opportunities
